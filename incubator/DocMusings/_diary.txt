Again, pool size error with oodialog :
! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [pool size=1286550].
--> Replace 1500000 by 2000000 in texm.cnf :
pool_size = 2000000


Since several weeks (months ?), I get ?? in toc and index.
oodialog : no number at all, only ?? everywhere 
--> This is because the first run of pdfjadetex returns an error and docbook2pdf stops after this first run.
    If I run pdfjadetex one more time by hand, then it's ok.
    Can't find where is the error... Or is it this message ?
        ! Undefined control sequence.
        \HeadingText ->2.3.4. \define 
                                      Statement
        l.46890 \endHeadPar{}
                             \endSeq{}\Node%
        The control sequence at the end of the top line
        of your error message was never \def'ed.
    --> If I remove the # or replace it in <title>#define Statement</title> by &num;
        then the error goes away...
        Impact on generated TeX :
        Line 46888
            #define :       {title-sosofo-mode}}\#define Statement\endNode{}\def\HeadingText{%
            &num;define :   {title-sosofo-mode}}\Entity{num}define Statement\endNode{}\def\HeadingText{%
            define  :       {title-sosofo-mode}}define Statement\endNode{}\def\HeadingText{%
        Line 46889
            #define :       2.3.4. \define Statement}%          <-- I think that \define brings the problem...
            &num;define :   2.3.4. define Statement}%
            define  :       2.3.4. define Statement}%
        

Remember, the PDF backend of docbook2pdf is here :
D:\Cygwin\usr\share\sgml\docbook\utils-0.6.14\backends\pdf
and was modified to not remove the .tmp and .tex file

After investigation, I see that an update of OpenJade has been installed on march 2010 (Cygwin setup, see /var/log/setup.log)

and the file /etc/sgml/catalog has been impacted.
New entries have been added, in relation with DocBook.
After removal of these new entries, the error is gone...


Another error (or warning ?)
jade:/usr/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets/print/dbttlpg.dsl:2722:6:E: flow object not accepted by port; only display flow objects accepted
I think that this error was not raised by the previous version of OpenJade/OpenSP
Don't seem to forbid the generation of the doc...


Another error with oodialog :
! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [pool size=1036550].
--> Add that to texm.cnf :
% pool_size = 1250000
pool_size = 1500000


===============================================================================
2009 august 01

I want to generate the PDF from WinXP using the Makefiles available in
docs/trunk
They depend on :
docbook2pdf
docbook2html
pdftex (and pdfjadetex) --> already installed outside cygwin, in TeXLive (but won't work, to reinstall under Cygwin)
collateindex.pl
jade
And they are only for Unix.

Cygwin seems to be the most reasonable choice to do that.
The setup shows only XML DocBook, nothing for SGML DocBook... Don't know if I make
the right choice... Added these packages to my current configuration :
docbook-xml-42-4.2-3
docbook-xml-43-4.3-1
docbook-xml-44-4.4-1
openjade-1.3.3-1
OpenSP-1.5.1-1
xmlto-0.0.18-2 (expected to have docbook2pdf inside, but this is not the case)

Create a symbolic link jade --> openjade
ln -s /usr/bin/openjade.exe /usr/bin/jade

docs/trunk/README does not indicate which version of DocBook DSSSL to use. 
I download the only version available from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/files/
1.79
Install it into /usr/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets
to be compatible with the Makefiles in docs/trunk/
Ensure you have these files :
/usr/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets/print/docbook.dsl
/usr/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets/html/docbook.dsl

Now following the instructions in \usr\share\sgml\docbook\dsssl-stylesheets\doc
Try :
jade -t rtf -d jtest.dsl jtest.sgm
Does not work...
It seems I need the SGML version of the catalogs.
Download from http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/sgml/
docbook-4.2.zip
docbook-4.3.zip
docbook-4.4.zip
Installed in /usr/share/sgml/docbook (following the same organisation as for xml)

Study of http://debian-xml-sgml.alioth.debian.org/sgml-policy/sgml-catalogs.html
Creation by hand of /etc/sgml/catalog which contains
CATALOG /usr/share/sgml/docbook/4.2/docbook.cat
CATALOG /usr/share/sgml/docbook/4.3/docbook.cat
CATALOG /usr/share/sgml/docbook/4.4/docbook.cat

Add that to ~/.bashrc :
export SGML_CATALOG_FILES=/etc/sgml/catalog

/usr/share/openjade seems incomplete : no catalog, whereas openjade's doc say :
<<
OpenJade requires the file dsssl/builtins.dsl to operate. 
You can tell OpenJade where this file is in one of two ways: 
By including a SYSTEM catalog entry for "builtins.dsl" pointing to this file. See dsssl/catalog for an example.
By including the dsssl/catalog catalog with the -c command line option or the SGML_CATALOG_FILES environment variable.
>>
Using Cygwin setup, I install the sources of openjade and OpenSP.
I don't want to build, only have a look at the source :
cd /usr/src
./openjade-1.3.3-1.sh prep
./OpenSP-1.5.1-1.sh prep
Ok, in /usr/src/openjade-1.3.3-pre1/dsssl
I find what I'm looking for : catalog and a bunch of dsl and dtd files.
Copy dsssl/* into /usr/share/openjade
And add this line to /etc/sgml/catalog :
CATALOG /usr/share/openjade/catalog

Retry : 
jade -t rtf -d jtest.dsl jtest.sgm
Good, it works...

Continue to follow the instructions in \usr\share\sgml\docbook\dsssl-stylesheets\doc
Try :
onsgmls -sv test.sgm (must replace nsgmls by onsgmls)
Does not work... This declaration in test.sgm seems deprecated :
<!doctype chapter public "-//Davenport//DTD DocBook V3.0//EN">
I download http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/sgml/3.0/docbk30.zip
Install it in /usr/share/sgml/docbook/3.0
Add this line to /etc/sgml/catalog :
CATALOG /usr/share/sgml/docbook/3.0/docbook.cat

Retry :
onsgmls -sv test.sgm (must replace nsgmls by onsgmls)
Does not work... SGML entities not found
Download http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/sgml/2.4.1/dbent241.zip
Extract the files and copy them directly in
/usr/share/sml/docbook/3.0
/usr/share/sml/docbook/4.2
/usr/share/sml/docbook/4.3
/usr/share/sml/docbook/4.4

Retry :
onsgmls -sv test.sgm (must replace nsgmls by onsgmls)
Good, it works...

Continue to follow the instructions in \usr\share\sgml\docbook\dsssl-stylesheets\doc
I have already installed the Modular DocBook Stylesheets in
/usr/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets (version 1.79)
Add this line to /etc/sgml/catalog :
CATALOG /usr/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets/catalog

Try :
jade -t rtf -d /usr/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets/print/docbook.dsl test.sgm
Good, it works...

Try :
jade -t sgml -d /usr/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets/html/docbook.dsl test.sgm
Good, it works...

collateindex.pl must be directly executable :
Add this path to ~/.bashrc :
PATH=/usr/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets/bin:${PATH}

Need docbook2pdf and docbook2html
No package available for Cygwin.
Download from http://cblfs.cross-lfs.org/index.php/DocBook_Utils
Follow the instructions, make and... error :
jade:../../doc/docbook-utils.sgml:1:55:W: cannot generate system identifier for public text "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN"
Ok, must install DocBook 3.1 :
I download http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/sgml/3.1/docbk31.zip
Install it in /usr/share/sgml/docbook/3.1
Add this line to /etc/sgml/catalog :
CATALOG /usr/share/sgml/docbook/3.1/docbook.cat

Retry make
Good, it works...
make install and... error :
cd: //usr/man/man1: No such file or directory
Don't care, it's about doc.
[later] 
Pfff, because of this error, I don't have the frontends installed.
After investigation, can't find from where comes this additional slash.
I add /. in front of cd $(DESTDIR)/$(mandir)/man1 in doc/Makefile, 
redo make install, and now the install is ok.

[Don't do that]
Remaining missing stuff : pdftex
Let's see if I can avoid to re-install TeXLive under Cygwin (already installed as a pure Windows package)
Add this path to ~/.bashrc :
PATH=/cygdrive/d/local/XmlToolSet/TeXLive/2008/bin/win32:${PATH}
Go to docs/trunk/readme
make
Does not work... pdftex can't work that way.
No choice, must install TeX under Cygwin.

I don't use the packages available via the setup because they are obsolete (tetex)
I prefer to install TeXLive from http://www.webalice.it/angelo.graziosi/cygwin/texlive/texlive.html
(yes, no cygwin binaries from the official TexLive site, so...)
Do the steps 0, 1 and 2.
NO NEED to download the iso image 1.246.282 KB, just use the network installer from
http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire.html
(default mirror too slow, using
./install-tl -no-gui -location ftp://ftp.inria.fr/pub/TeX/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/
)
Install medium scheme (f)
It's ok to have "no available_architectures, continuing anyway"
When done, add this path to ~/.bashrc :
PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-cygwin:${PATH}
Remember : tlmgr for managing TEX Live after the initial installation.
Ex : tlmgr list
Ex : tlmgr list schemes
Must install scheme-xml to have passivetex, jadetex :
tlmgr install scheme-xml

Copy the contents of docs/trunk/texmf.cnf into /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf.cnf

Try again, go to docs/trunk/readme
make
Good, it works... I have a pdf and a html

Go to docs/trunk/rexxref
make
Good, it works... but it's slooow : about 45 min
