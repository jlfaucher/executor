First step : 
I want to see if I can read an sgml file with the XML parser, and dump it almost as-is
(I want to keep the current layout in the files).
I don't know if I can do that only by overriding the public methods, so I made a
copy of the parser.

Second step :
Generate a valid XML file.

Third step :
Write a script which iterates over the sgml files from a given root and generates
a valid XML file for each sgml file.

For the moment, nothing implemented...
