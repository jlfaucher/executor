By default, XXE does not use cdata when saving programlisting. Since the conversion
of syntax diagrams to image depends on cdata, must find a way to keep the cdata...

Configuration and deployment
Chapter 5 Customizing an existing configuration
DocBook
 I'm under WinXP, my addon directory is
 C:\Documents and Settings\JFaucher\Application Data\XMLmind\XMLEditor4\addon
 Create the subdirectory docbook.
 Copy 0docbook.xxe to addon\docbook.
 Restart XXE
 Help/About XMLmind : you must see your custom config file in the list.


Other technique : use the variable XXE_ADDON_PATH
set XXE_ADDON_PATH=D:\local\Rexx\ooRexx\svn\incubator\DocMusings\xxe;+
Doc excerpt :
The content of this variable must be a list of directory names separated by character ";" (even on Unix). 
All the directories referenced in this list are recursively scanned by XXE.
If this path ends with ";+", the addon/ subdirectory of XXE installation directory is also scanned at startup time. 


Now I have a custom configuration file, I can keep the cdata under programlisting :
<saveOptions cdataSectionElements="programlisting" ...


By default, XXE indents the XML file, better to not ident :
<saveOptions indent="none" ...


The resulting saved file is still very different from the original layout.
Not sure I can do better... So XXE is probably not recommended to edit the ooRexx doc,
but it can be used as a preview tool.
