The implementation can handle data files in 2 modes:

1. Use impl_data.h to include all data files and disable them with config defines if needed
2. Automatically include specific data file in the implementation file that use that data

Define UNI_ALGO_STATIC_DATA is used to enable mode 2.

For example in C++ it can be used to implement a library that compiles data files in .cpp file (mode 1)
or header-only library that includes data files in .h files (mode 2).
Default C++ Standard Library wrapper implements both modes.
