What it does is it introduces a new symbol, @ â€“ stolen from F#, which gives you access to the syntax tree of a function during runtime and allows you to modify it as you see fit and then compile it to a regular JavaScript function.

F# code quotation
This topic describes code quotations, a language feature that enables you to generate and work with F# code expressions programmatically. This feature lets you generate an abstract syntax tree that represents F# code. The abstract syntax tree can then be traversed and processed according to the needs of your application. For example, you can use the tree to generate F# code or generate code in some other language.
