Re: [Oorexx-devel] ooRexx Performance
To squeeze a bit of performance REXX should be built with the   Interprocedural optimization (IPO)  activated

My tests showed an increase in performance between 5 and 8 %

Use the make module CheckIPOSupported
And if supported define the property  for the relevant <modules>
set_property( TARGET ……….  PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE )

( the Rexx executable, the rexx library , the rexxapi library , the rxapi  executable the rexxc executable  )

 pretty easy
