[bugs:#1404] Some method args don't honor REQUEST("STRING")

Erich:
neither Bag nor Stem have a makeString() method, so all of those three examples should fail, but they pass instead.

.Stream~new(.Stem~new)
1~append(.Bag~new)
1~caselessEquals(.Bag~new)

Rick:
Stem doesn't have a makeString method, but it overrides request() and sends the request on to the default value. That one is working correctly.

I'm a bit leery about fixing this. There are basically two mechanisms at play here:
1) a method requires a string argument.
   This mechanism uses request('STRING') on the argument and raises an error if a string value is not obtained.
2) a method, or command, builtin function, or operator requires a string value always.
   In this case, request('STRING') is tried first, a NOSTRING condition is raised and then the objects STRING value is used.

Originally it was envisioned that all "classic" Rexx situations would use 2) and methods would use 1).
However, a lot of the classic Rexx features, such as all of the operators, are implemented as methods
of the string class, so these methods, at least, need to use 2) because they fall into the other category.

It appears that most of the methods in the string class got implemented using mechanism 2).
We can't convert everything to 1) because the operator methods still need to use 2).
I'm not sure I'm comfortable having mixed modes here.
Perhaps it would be better to just defined that the string methods always use 2)
when a string argument is used and do a trawl through the code to make sure they are all consistent.

Q from Erich)
In 5.0, Array's string() method gives a different result than Array's makeString() method. I believe this is the only class with such a behavior.

Is this to be regarded as a bug?

say (1, 2)~string -- an Array
say (1, 2)~makeString -- 1 nl 2

A from Rick)
They do not need to be the same and there is some history behind why array is special.

As originally designed, the makeString method was meant to be used for automatic coercion to string values where request('STRING') is used, while a manual request should have been handled by providing a different method such as toString (which array also has). The string method is meant as an absolute fallback that does not do a lot of processing, used for things like error messages and trace. For example, you would not want an array makeString method called during processing of an error triggered by an out of memory condition.

This was a bit bungled when makeString was originally added to array such that request('STRING') was still returning the result of the string method rather than the constructed string value and also resulted in array makeString being the only one that takes arguments. Typically a make<classname> method should not have arguments because it is really intended just for interaction with the request mechanism. This is why the array class also has a toString method today.

Anyway, yes it is correct that they are different since the methods are intended for different purposes.
