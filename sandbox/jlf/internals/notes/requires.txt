Code review to understand how ::requires works
===============================================================================

A package is loaded once.
This is managed by the interpreter instance.
See InterpreterInstance::getRequiresFile

Each package manages its own list of loaded packages.
See RexxSource::addPackage

Optimisation at the package level :
The imported routines and classes are merged in a RexxDirectory : merged_public_routines
My understanding : that avoids to walk through all the imported packages to find the routine/class.
See RexxSource::mergeRequired(RexxSource *source)

JLF : this is another entry point to add a package
Here, the package is already loaded, since passed as a parameter.
So the interpreter instance is not sollicited.
Only the package to which the other package is added is sollicited.

RexxObject *PackageClass::addPackage(PackageClass *package)
{
    classArgument(package, ThePackageClass, "package");
    source->addPackage(package);
    return this;
}
