This paper describes a model of pattern matching implemented using the Python programming language. It's designed with the following objectives:
- To describe the style of pattern matching found in the SNBOL4, Icon and OmniMark programming languages to those who don't have an opportunity to use those languages.
- To provide examples of the advantage of a streaming approach to pattern matching as found in the OmniMark language, its predecessor the Hugo language, and in Unix's "lex" utility.
- As an attempt to fit pattern matching into the Python language in a more expressive and powerful manner than the existing "re" pattern matching library.
- To explain pattern matching in an accessible fashion, and to show that it's not such a difficult subject
