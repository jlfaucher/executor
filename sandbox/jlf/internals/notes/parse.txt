jlf: it's about regular expressions and declarative patterns.
They use Unicode data tables for an example of parsing.
Consider these two lines:
    007F..009F    ; Control # Cc  [33] <control-007F>..<control-009F>
    00AD          ; Control # Cf       SOFT HYPHEN
We can match them and extract the data using the regular expression:
    /([0-9A-F]+)(?:\.\.([0-9A-F]+))?\s*;\s(\w+).*/
Pattern uses a more versatile syntax (just regular Swift code!) and supports matching more complex languages than Regex.

This paper describes a model of pattern matching implemented using the Python programming language. It's designed with the following objectives:
- To describe the style of pattern matching found in the SNBOL4, Icon and OmniMark programming languages to those who don't have an opportunity to use those languages.
- To provide examples of the advantage of a streaming approach to pattern matching as found in the OmniMark language, its predecessor the Hugo language, and in Unix's "lex" utility.
- As an attempt to fit pattern matching into the Python language in a more expressive and powerful manner than the existing "re" pattern matching library.
- To explain pattern matching in an accessible fashion, and to show that it's not such a difficult subject

When talking about pattern matching in the context of Perl 6, people usually think about regex or grammars.
Those are indeed very powerful tools for pattern matching, but not the only one.
Another powerful tool for pattern matching and for unpacking data structures uses signatures.
