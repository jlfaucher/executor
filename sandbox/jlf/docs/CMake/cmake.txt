CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

For single-config generators (e.g. Unix Makefiles, Ninja, NMake Makefiles) CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is unset.
until:
- you pass -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=..., or
- you set it inside your CMakeLists.txt.
So the initial value is literally empty.

For multi-config generators (e.g. Visual Studio, Xcode, Ninja Multi-Config)
These generators do not use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE at all.
Instead they support multiple configurations simultaneously: Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel.
The real configurations are stored in CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
