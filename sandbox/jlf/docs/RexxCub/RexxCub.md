I wanna be a Rexx coder, Rexx Cub       <br/>
And stroll right into source code       <br/>
And be just like the other Rexx coders  <br/>
I'm tired of monkeyin' around           <br/>
</p>

<p align="center">
Oh oobah doo                    <br/>
I wanna code like you           <br/>
I wanna type like you           <br/>
Extend like you too             <br/>
You see it's true               <br/>
An INIT just won't do           <br/>
Give me the tricks of ooRexx    <br/>
To be like you                  <br/>
</p>

<p align="center">
You strut with extensions, clean and tight      <br/>
Your loops are lean, your scope just right      <br/>
You’ve got that OO metaclass heavenward         <br/>
While I just crash with missing INIT forward    <br/>
</p>

<p align="center">
Oh oobah doo                    <br/>
I wanna code like you           <br/>
I wanna think like you          <br/>
Refactor too                    <br/>
You extend through              <br/>
With unlocked features          <br/>
Give me the keys to ooRexx      <br/>
To be like you                  <br/>
</p>

<p align="center">
Now here's your part of the deal, cuz       <br/>
Lay the secret on me of ooRexx extensions   <br/>
</p>

<p align="center">
Now, don't try to kid me, Rexx Cub      <br/>
I made a deal with you                  <br/>
What I desire is ooRexx extensions      <br/>
To make my dream come true              <br/>
</p>

<p align="center">
Now give me the secret, Rexx Cub    <br/>
Come on                             <br/>
Clue me what to do                  <br/>
Give me the power                   <br/>
Of ooRexx extensions                <br/>
So I can extend like you            <br/>
