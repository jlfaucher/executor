<https://sourceforge.net/p/oorexx/bugs/1553/>; has another pipe-related patch by Matth√© van der Lee
from December 3rd 2018, which might have been overlooked. Just in case a reminder.

Here is his statement: "For my own amusement, I have rewritten the pipe.rex sample, and included
support for multistream pipelines and for many of the pipeline stage commands as provided by CMS
Pipelines. I attach the source here, as well as that of the adapted demo usepipe.rex. Comments
welcomed." His version is attached to the above URL and can be directly downloaded for evaluation
and testing.
