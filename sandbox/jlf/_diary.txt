Sandbox for experimental work, some ideas to investigate :

Try to understand the internal locks.
--> added some OutputDebugString (Windows only), now must analyze...

Allow extension of the predefined ooRexx classes to get something similar to C# extension methods (but more powerful).

Add the "in" keyword to the DO repetitor : Similar to "over" but calls the method "supplier" instead of "makearray".
See if a thread could return more than one result and become a generator when synchronized with : do i in generator ...

Export the classes instantiated by the parser and make expression instances available from an ooRexx script. 
Inspired by C# LINQ and the expression tree API.
See if that can be used to write macros (i.e. transform expression tree), user directives, DSL...

Named parameters (by opposition to positional parameters). 
In C#, they say it's useful for calling COM services. 
I have some Excel macros that would be simpler to call with that.

Deferred evaluation of parameters. 
Let the routine/method decide which parameters must be evaluated, ex : iif(cond, iftrue, ifalse)

Investigate the Activation stack (reify ? closure ? continuation ?)
